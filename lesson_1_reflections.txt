How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    This way I see the line numbers where input differs

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It's easier to restore a last working version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Doing things manually may save some memory however it's time consuming. You never know when you have an electricity outage or smth thus doing this automatically is safer

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It's a domain-specific thing: while coding you usually modify a project/a bunh of files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log helps you to see the commmits and stats and git diff to compare two commits to see where the error occured

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You're free to eperiment on your project as you can easily revert to the previous commit

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To work on my projects and collaborate with others
