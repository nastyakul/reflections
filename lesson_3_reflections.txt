When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you're working with colaborators or on multiple machines accessing the same code

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    May be you want to reimplement the idea there's on remote on your machine.
    Or let's say the owner decided to delete a lot of files but you still want
    to have them being a co-author of the project.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Clone is used to copy a remote repo to a local machine.
    Fork is a kind of clone creating a copy of a remote repo which is not owned by you saving the credidetials of the author. It can be seen as a branch but you don't own a real project and the author can't merge.
    Branch is a version of the project that you or your colaborators owe.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
